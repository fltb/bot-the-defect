# Modular Role-Playing Chatbot Framework

A highly modular and extensible chatbot framework built with **LlamaIndex** and **Melobot**. This project demonstrates how to build a complex, maintainable, and feature-rich application using a layered architecture and modern design patterns. Its initial use case is to role-play as characters from a visual novel, but its architecture is designed to support multiple chat modes, scheduled tasks, and admin functionalities out of the box.

## ‚ú® Key Features

  - **ü§ñ Multi-Mode Chat Engine**:

      - **Role-Playing Mode (`pwvn`)**: Deeply integrated with **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** to enable rich, in-character conversations based on a predefined knowledge base (character backstories, dialogue snippets).
      - **General QA Mode (`plain`)**: A standard, stateful question-and-answer mode suitable for general assistant scenarios.
      - **Factory Pattern Driven**: Easily extend the bot with new chat modes by adding new Factory and Service classes with minimal configuration changes.

  - **‚öôÔ∏è Powerful Session Management**:

      - Full support for multi-user and multi-session isolation.
      - Users can create, switch, list, and delete sessions with simple commands.
      - Supports dynamic switching of character roles and Large Language Models (LLMs) within an active session.

  - **üöÄ Proactive & Scheduled Tasks**:

      - Includes a built-in task scheduling service powered by `APScheduler`.
      - Comes with a pre-built **Daily RSS News Feed** feature that automatically fetches, aggregates, and pushes news to configured group chats at a specific time.

  - **üîë Admin Functionality**:

      - A configuration-based permission system for admin users.
      - Admins can trigger background jobs, reload configurations (extensible), and perform other administrative tasks.

  - **üîå Dual Adapter Support**:

      - **OneBot V11 Adapter**: Connects to any OneBot v11 compatible chat platform (e.g., QQ) via `melobot`.
      - **Command-Line Adapter**: A full-featured local development tool that can test all core functionalities, including **simulated message pushing**, without needing a live bot connection.

  - **üîß Clean, Modern Architecture**:

      - **Strictly Layered**: The application is cleanly divided into an Adapter Layer, a Core Layer, and a Services Layer.
      - **Dependency Injection**: Services are assembled centrally at the application's entry point (`adapter/`), promoting high cohesion and low coupling.
      - **Programming to Interfaces**: Core components communicate through abstract interfaces (`interfaces.py`), not concrete implementations.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Overview

This project uses a strict three-layer architecture to ensure a clean separation of concerns, enhancing maintainability and testability.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1\. Prerequisites

  - **Python**: Ensure you have Python `3.13` or newer installed.
  - **uv**: This project uses `uv` as its package manager. If you don't have it, please follow the official guide to install it.

### 2\. Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/fltb/bot-the-defect
cd bot-the-defect

# Install all dependencies using uv
uv sync
```

### 3\. Configuration

All project configurations are managed via environment variables.

```bash
# First, copy the example file
cp .env.example .env
```

Next, edit the `.env` file with your specific settings:

  - **`ONEBOT_WS_URL`**: The WebSocket URL of your OneBot v11 implementation (e.g., go-cqhttp).
  - **`BOT_QQ_ID`**: Your bot's QQ ID number.
  - **`USE_OLLAMA`**: Set to `true` to use a local Ollama model; otherwise, it will use DeepSeek.
  - **`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`**: Your API key if you are using DeepSeek.
  - **`ADMIN_USER_IDS`**: A comma-separated list of admin QQ IDs (e.g., `10001,10002`).
  - **`NEWS_...`**: Configure the schedule and target group chats for the daily news feed.
  - **`RSS_...`**: Configure the RSS feed URLs for the news service.

### 4\. Prepare the Knowledge Base

Place your character definitions, dialogue data, and other knowledge files into the `knowledge/` directory. Modify `config/settings.py` if nessesary. The application will automatically build the RAG index from these files on its first run.

## üïπÔ∏è Usage

The project provides two modes for running the application:

### Production Mode (with OneBot)

This starts the full application, including the connection to the OneBot V11 backend and the background task scheduler.

```bash
uv run run.py
```

### Development & Testing Mode (CLI)

This is a powerful local development tool that runs without connecting to QQ. It allows you to test all commands and chat logic, and it will **simulate background task message pushes directly in your console**.

```bash
uv run run.py --adapter cli
```

## üìö Command Reference

Send commands via a private message or by @-mentioning the bot in a group chat.

| Command | Alias(es) | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/new` | - | `/new <mode> [args...]` - Creates a new session. Available modes: `pwvn`, `plain` |
| `/ls` | - | Lists all of your available sessions. |
| `/ss` | - | `/ss <session_id>` - Switches to the specified session using the first few chars of its ID. |
| `/dels`| - | `/dels <session_id>` - Deletes a session. |
| `/ds` | - | Displays detailed information about the current active session. |
| `/sbr` | - | `/sbr <role_name>` - (pwvn mode only) Switches the bot's character role. |
| `/sur` | - | `/sur <role_name>` - (pwvn mode only) Switches your user role. |
| `/sl` | - | `/sl <model_name>` - Switches the LLM for the current session (e.g., `deepseek-chat` or `ollama/qwen2.5`). |
| `/help`| - | Displays this help message. |

### Admin Commands

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `/admin trigger_news` | Manually triggers the daily news feed job. |
| `/admin reload` | (Placeholder) Reloads application configurations. |

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Extend

This architecture is built for extension.

### Adding a New Chat Mode

1.  **Create the Service**: Create a new chat service class in the `services/` directory that implements the `IChatService` interface.
2.  **Create the Factory**: Create a new factory class in `services/factories.py` that implements the `IChatServiceFactory` interface. Its `create_service` method should be responsible for instantiating your new service.
3.  **Register the Factory**: In `cli_adapter.py` and `onebot_adapter.py`, instantiate your new factory and add it to the `factories` dictionary with a unique mode name as the key (e.g., `'my_new_mode'`).
4.  **Done\!** Users can now access your new chat mode via the `/new my_new_mode` command.
